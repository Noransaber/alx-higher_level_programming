## Introduction
**Python is a versatile and easy-to-learn programming language that is widely used in web development, data science, automation, and more. This repository aims to provide a structured and comprehensive learning path to master Python programming concepts and best practices**.

## Getting Started
To get started with learning Python from this repository, you'll need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage your Python projects. You can set up a virtual environment using virtualenv or venv. Once you have your virtual environment set up, activate it and install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.

## Python Basics
In this section, you'll find introductory materials to Python, including data types, variables, operators, and basic input/output. Start by reading the python_basics.md file, and then explore the examples in the examples folder to gain a better understanding of the concepts.

## Control Flow
The control_flow.md file introduces control flow statements in Python, such as if-else, loops, and more. The examples folder contains code snippets demonstrating how these control flow structures can be used in practical scenarios.

## Functions
Learn about functions, one of the fundamental building blocks in Python, in the functions.md file. The examples folder provides real-world examples of function definitions and usage.

## Data Structures
Explore different data structures, including lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets, in the data_structures.md file. The examples folder demonstrates various operations and manipulations on these data structures.

## File Handling
In the file_handling.md file, you'll learn how to read from and write to files in Python. The examples folder contains code snippets showing how to handle files effectively.

## Modules
Discover how to work with modules, import external libraries, and create your own modules in Python using the information provided in the modules.md file.

## Object-Oriented Programming
The oop.md file introduces you to object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Python, including classes, objects, inheritance, and more. The examples folder demonstrates practical implementations of OOP principles.

## Advanced Topics
The advanced_topics.md file covers more advanced Python topics, such as decorators, generators, and context managers. The examples folder provides code snippets illustrating the usage of these advanced features.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions from the community to make this repository even better. If you find any issues, have suggestions, or want to add more examples, feel free to submit a pull request. Please follow the guidelines in the CONTRIBUTING.md file.

## License
This repository is licensed under the MIT License. For more details, see the LICENSE file.

**Happy coding, and have fun learning Python! 🚀🐍**

How to print text and variables using print
How to use strings
What are indexing and slicing in Python
What is the official Python coding style and how to check your code with pycodestyle
Copyright - Plagiarism
You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet with the above learning objectives.
You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone else’s work.
You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.
Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.
Requirements
Python Scripts
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
A README.md file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project, is mandatory
Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc
Shell Scripts
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
All your scripts should be exactly two lines long (wc -l file should print 2)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/bin/bash
All your files must be executable
C Scripts
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All your files should end with a new line
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called lists.h
Don’t forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded
